# netherland-rabbits-backend
Node.js backend for Netherland Rabbits website.  
<br>
This backend exists to provide the frontend with inventory data, specifically a listing of Netherland Dwarf rabbits that are for sale.  The data includes names, DOBs, pedigree, awards received, etc.  The data is pulled from a Google spreadsheet, in an effort to make the inventory listing easy to manage for a less technically inclined operator.
